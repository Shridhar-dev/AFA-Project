        image: 'Canon 500D.jpeg',
        description: 'What sets this camera apart from the original Canon EOS 500D, is that it is tailor-made for astrophotography. It is modified to ensure accurate depictions of the red hues associated with many deep-sky emission nebula targets. The CMOS camera sensor has an increased sensitivity to hydrogen-alpha (Hα), which sits at the 656nm transmission line. On regular (stock) DSLR camera bodies, this wavelength is significantly cut off due to its impracticality for daytime photography uses.'
